Load a website of your choosing in new Chrome tabs. Set the custom URL in
page.html. Also helps to set a default link target on this page:

    <base target="_parent" />

Other extensions redirect the page with JavaScript, taking the text cursor
focus away from the location bar for every new tab. The iframe does not suffer
from this issue.
